- 👋 Hi, I’m @NolanGio and I want to stop sucking at programming to work as a software engineer, as game developer, or maybe I'll throw everything to just make business.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how do computer work and how manipulate data in such a fancy way and well I'd like to learn Unity maybe.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Pyhton and Pygame.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever I can help with once I get knowledge.
- 📫 How to reach me, don't, I'm lazy and introvert and plus this Github is not gonna have stuff until I learn C# and that is suffering.
